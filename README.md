# PostHog Community App: Unduplicates

This app helps prevent duplicate events from being ingested into PostHog. It's particularly helpful if you're backfilling information while you're already ingesting ongoing events. The app crafts an event UUID based on key properties for the event so if the event is _the same_ (see below for definition) it'll end with the same UUID.

When events areprocessed by ClickHouse, the DB will automatically dedupe events which have the same `toDate(timestamp)`,
`event`, `distinct_id` and `uuid` combo, effectively making sure duplicates are not stored.

The app has two modes (which essentially define what's considered a duplicate event). Either mode will scope duplicates to a **each project**, duplicates across projects are still permitted.

-   **Event and Timestamp**. An event will be treated as duplicate if the timestamp, event name and user's distinct ID matches exactly, regardless of what internal properties are included.
-   **All Properties**. An event will be treated as duplicate only all properties match exactly, as well as the timestamp, event name and user's distinct ID.
